Tasks to complete
Create a new empty array literal and assign it to the variable clothes.

Add 5 of your favorite items of clothing as strings using the push() method.

Remove the fifth piece of clothing from the array using the pop() method.

Add a new piece of clothing using the push() method.

Use console.log to show the third item from the clothes array in the console.

Create a new empty object literal and assign it to the variable favCar.

Using the dot notation, assign a color property to the favCar object and give it a string value with the color of your choice.

Using the dot notation, assign a covertible property to the favCar object and give it a boolean value of your choice.

Use the console to log the entire favCar object.

Task 1: Code a function declaration
You need to code a function declaration named addTwoNums, which accepts numbers a and b and console logs a + b.

Task 2: Invoke the addTwoNums function with a number and a string
You need to invoke the addTwoNums using the following arguments: 5 and "5".

Task 3: Update the addTwoNums function with a try...catch block
Add the try and catch blocks inside the function definition's body. For now, just make sure that the console log of a + b is inside the try block. Additionally, the catch block should catch an error named err and, inside the body of the catch block, you need to console log the err value.

Task 4: If the passed-in arguments are not numbers, throw an error
If either of the arguments passed to the addTwoNums are not numbers, you'll throw an error.

Specifically, code a conditional with the following logic:

if the typeof the a parameter is not equal to 'number', throw a new ReferenceError. Inside the ReferenceError, pass a custom error message of 'the first argument is not a number'.

else if the typeof the b parameter is not equal to 'number', throw a new ReferenceError. Inside the ReferenceError, pass a custom error message of 'the second argument is not a number'.

else, console log a + b  

Once you've completed this task, all the code inside the try block will be inside these conditional statements.

Task 5: Update the catch block
Inside the catch block, update the code from console.log(err) to console.log("Error!", err).

Task 6: Invoke the addTwoNums function
Invoke the addTwoNums function using 5 and "5" as arguments.

Task 7: Add another console log under the addTwoNums function invocation
Add another line of code that console logs the string "It still works".

How would you then refactor the function given below with defensive programming in mind?

For this exercise, let's make sure that both of the arguments that are passed in satisfy the following criteria:

The length of the word parameter cannot be less than 2.

The length of the match parameter must be 1.

The type of both the word and the match parameters must be string.

You will use the code below to complete your task:


function letterFinder(word, match) {
    for(i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
        if(word[i] == match) {
            //if the current character at position i in the word is equal to the match
            console.log('Found the', match, 'at', i)
        } else {
            console.log('---No match found at', i)
        }
    }
}

Reset
Here are the tasks to complete:

Just above the for loop in the letterFinder function definition, declare a variable named condition1 and assign to it the following code: typeof(word) == 'string' && word.length >= 2.

Declare a variable named condition2 on the next line and assign to it and assign to it a check that makes sure that the type of match is a string AND that the length of the match variable is equal to 1.

Write an if statement on the next line that checks that condition1 is true, and condition2 is true

Move the rest of the function's body into the if statement you wrote in the previous step.

Code an "else" block after the "if" condition and console.log the following: "Please pass correct arguments to the function.".

As a failing test, run the letterFinder function and pass it with any two numbers as arguments.

As a passing test, run the letterFinder funciton and pass it with correct arguments, such as: letterFinder("cat", "c").
